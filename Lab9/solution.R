# The error occurs because the 'mean()' function is being applied directly to the result of the 'select()' function, which returns a data frame, not a vector. 
# To fix this, you should use 'pull()' from the 'dplyr' package to extract the age and salary columns as vectors before applying the 'mean()' function:

# Load required package
library(dplyr)

# Calculate average age
average_age <- data %>% select(age) %>% pull() %>% mean()

# Calculate average salary
average_salary <- data %>% select(salary) %>% pull() %>% mean()

# Print the results
cat("The average age is:", average_age, "\n")
cat("The average salary is:", average_salary, "\n")

# Here's the R script with browser() added before calculating the average age:
# Load required package
library(dplyr)

# Data
data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eva"),
  age = c(25, 30, 28, 33, 27),
  salary = c(60000, 55000, 70000, 68000, 62000)
)

# Add browser() just before the line where you want to start debugging
browser()

# Calculate average age
average_age <- data %>% select(age) %>%  mean()

# Calculate average salary
average_salary <- data %>% select(salary) %>%  mean()

# Print the results
cat("The average age is:", average_age, "\n")
cat("The average salary is:", average_salary, "\n")

# When you run this script, the execution will pause at the browser() line. 
# At this point, you can type expressions in the console to examine the data, 
# such as data or data$age. 
# You can also run the problematic line step-by-step and inspect intermediate results, 
# like data %>% select(age) and so on.
# To continue the script execution, type c or cont in the console, 
# and the script will resume running until it encounters another browser() statement or finishes. 
# To exit the browser and stop the script, type Q or quit.
# Remember to remove the browser() line from your script once you've finished debugging.
